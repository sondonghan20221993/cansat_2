# 05. Reconstruction Requirements

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the requirements for the image-based 3D reconstruction module.

The module SHALL use a DUSt3R-family pipeline as the primary reconstruction approach.
It SHALL accept image inputs collected from the drone, execute reconstruction on a
remote GPU server, and return 3D reconstruction outputs and quality metadata for
downstream integration.

At the current system planning stage, GLB is the most likely primary external output
format. Both the reconstruction model and the output format may change in future
revisions; therefore the module SHALL be structured to support replacement without
breaking the module boundary contract.

Coordinate systems, timestamps, and shared interface rules SHALL follow the top-level
system documents and the interface specification (03-interface-specification.md).

### 5.2 Quality Metadata

- **REC-OUT-05**: The reconstruction module SHALL include quality metadata in each output.
